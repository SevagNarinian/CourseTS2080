## What is object oriented programming?

object oriented programing opp is a compiter programming model that organizes
software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. 
an object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and begavior.

OOP focyses on the objects that developers want to manupulate rather than the
logic required tp manipulate them. this appoach to progrmaing is well suited
for proframs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. this
includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications;
for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.

## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

the main concepts/principles of OOP are abstraction, encapsulation, ingeritance 
and polymorphism


## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the inclusion of one thing within another thing so that the
included thisng is not apparent. In OOP it refers to the bounding of data, along
with the methods that operate in that data, into a single unit. 

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of taking away or removing characteristics from something 
in order to reduce it:
- it helps with preventing code repetition
- improve flexibility
- enables teamwork
- 

## Inheritance

Inheritance is the cincept that when a class of objects is defined, any subclass that 
is defined can ingerit the defintions of one or more general classes.
- modular code base.
- code reusability.
- less develpment.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the provision of a single inteface to entities of different types, or 
the use of a single symbole tp represent mutiple different types. 
polymorphism is essential to opp where object are defined as clasees.
